FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) is able to convert a signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. IFFT (Inverse FFT) converts a signal from the frequency domain to the time domain. The FFT of a non-periodic signal will cause the resulting frequency spectrum to suffer from leakage. Origin provides several windows for performing FFT to suppress leakage.

Sorry, i couldn't fulfill the Audio Analyze, because i don't know how to add audio on MatLab.
Sorry if i didn't perform well on the presentation
